# HypixelStats
Discontinued Hypixel Stats discord bot made by Slice#1007 (on discord).

How to setup:
1. Copy all the files into a folder
2. Join the hypixel server and generate an api token through /api
3. Copy that token into api_token = 'hypixel api token here'; Replace the hypixel api token here with your token
4. Go to https://discord.com/developers and make a discord application
5. Go to the tab bot and turn your application into a discord bot
6. Copy the bot token and paste it in const token = 'bot token here'; replace bot token here with your bot token
7. Install nodejs
8. Run 'node .' in the command prompt inside the folder with your bot files
9. Invite it to your server (https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)

This bot has been discontinued and is allowed to be used wherever you want with the condition that you dont remove/edit commands that credit me and dont remove/edit the footers of the MessageEmbeds.
I also work on a different discord bot called Trinity.
